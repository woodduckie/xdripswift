        //
        // the value used for CBCentralManagerOptionRestoreIdentifierKey depends :
        // - when scanning for a new device (or peripheral), use a random string. Disadvantage of using a random string is that willRestoreState doesn't get called when the app relaunches, because not the same value will be used (as it's a random string) - for this reason, we'll store this string in userdefaults (not shared, just local to this scope) and use when relaunching.
        // - when scanning for (better : trying to connect to) a known device, the device's mac address is used. In that case, after restart, it will be the same value. In this case the function willRestoreState gets called
        //
        // additional notes :
        // - the only reason why it's good to see willRestoreState starting, is because there's a trace statement in it. This allows to see in trace files if there was a restart after crash or being thrown out of memory
